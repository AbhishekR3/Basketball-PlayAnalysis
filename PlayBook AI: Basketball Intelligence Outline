This is my idea outline for this project.
Some of these are things I read online and thought might be applicable.
I also use this as a document to note down things I need to research and general planning.


######################### Upcoming Release - v0.1.1 #########################
- Multi-object tracking has been implemented with DeepSORT algorithm
- Created a custom model with image segmentation based on YOLOv10m
- Validation Metrics:
--- YOLO Object Detection - mAP50 (0.977), Precision (0.973), Recall (0.891)
--- DeepSORT - MAPSE (-0.8017), MOTP (0.4706), IDF1 (0.0618)
- Simulation file has been updated to include an outline color and center dot for each object to improve accuracy
- Implemented GPU accelerated programming reducing object tracking time by 57.56%
- General optimizations/bug fixing

- NN - 

######################### Notes #########################
1. Deep Sort Paper
- Combinations of big/small objects doesnt work well. 
Think about making the objects closer in size? It has a scale threshold too

- Scale threshold (important) + reduction threshold

- Current frame-previous frame matching search takes the longest time to process
So you should reduce the dimensions
-> Dimensions
- Basketball - color + x_coordinate + y_coordinates - x1
- Player - color + x_coordinate + y_coordinates - x10
-> Algorithms
- PCA (For efficiency)
- t-SNE (For Visualization)
