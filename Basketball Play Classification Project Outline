######################### Project Outline #########################
Create simulations of plays using Pygame
- Pass
- Steal
- Screens
- Pick and roll
- Delay action
Will be adding more plays

Object Detections
- Create a mask of the basketball court image
- Using HoughCircles detect the circles

Object Tracking
- Deep Sort (helps considering occuluion)

3D CNN model (?Temporal Action Localization?)
- C3D
- LSTM 
- RNN - many to many based model

Optimizers
- Adam (Adaptive Moment Estimation)
- SGD + Momentum
- Nesterov Accelerated Gradient (NAG)
- Adagrad

Optimize learning rate
- Cosine 
- /10 after every 20 epochs

######################### Optimization #########################
1. Research -> Optimize the FPS


2. Create function to prevent occlusion of players constantly in simulation


3. Resolve issue moving ball to another side of the player

4. CourtVision
- Background Subtraction
--> MOG2
--> KNN
--> PCA
