Detection
- randomly sampling a pyramid scale - skipped
- pooling is skipped
- multi-region strategies to combine features at different scales and levels - skipped
---> But it's better

Appearence Feature
Input
- Size - 96x96
- pool5 layer is 3x3
Output
- fully connected layer

Tracker
- Kalman filter + Kuhn-Munkres algorithm
- Since the Kuhn-Munkres algorithm attempts to yield the global optimal result, it may fail when some detections are missing. 
To this end, we use a two-stage matching strategy, which divides T t−1 into high tracking
quality set Tt−1 and low quality set Tt−1.

Combinations of big/small objects doesnt work well. 
Think about making the objects closer in size. 

Current frame-previous frame matching search takes the longest time to process
So you should reduce the dimensions
