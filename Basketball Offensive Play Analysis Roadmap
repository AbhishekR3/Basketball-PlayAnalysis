######################### Future Road Map #########################
Object Tracking
- Deep Sort (helps considering occuluion)

3D CNN model (?Temporal Action Localization?)
- C3D
- LSTM 
- RNN - many to many based model

Optimizers
- Adam (Adaptive Moment Estimation)
- SGD + Momentum
- Nesterov Accelerated Gradient (NAG)
- Adagrad

Optimize learning rate
- Cosine 
- /10 after every 20 epochs


Create simulations for new plays
- Screens

######################### Optimization #########################
1. Research -> Optimize the FPS


2. Create function to prevent occlusion of players constantly in simulation


3. Resolve issue moving ball to another side of the player
- In the 'Basketball Game Simulation' file


4. CourtVision
- Background Subtraction
--> MOG2
--> KNN
--> PCA

5. Does matching the object detection tracker circle matter
In Basketball_Object_Tracking.py, check the color_detection()
Switching value from RGB to BGR so it matches the color of the  BGR to RGB value
